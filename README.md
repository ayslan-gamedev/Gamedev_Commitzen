This repository creates an automatic way to write automatically organized commits through git commands, using a commit patter to game development repositories for more descriptive and informative commit messages.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Initial Setup

  Follow the steps below to set up and start using this commit pattern in your project:
  
  ### 1. Make sure you already have node.js installed on your machine.
  
  If you don't have Node.js installed yet, install in [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en)
  
  ### 2. Start the repository and enter the following commands to install dependencies into the repository:

    npm init
    npm install --save-dev commitizen cz-customizable

  ### 3. Extract the files released in this repository
  
  ### 4. Then move the ‚Äú.czrc‚Äù and ‚Äú.cz-config.js‚Äù files to the root of the repository.
  
  ### 5. write the following lines in your .gitignore file:
    # Node Modules (commitzen dependencies)
    /node_modules/
    
    # CommitzenConfiguration
    .czrc
    .cz-config.js
    package.json
    package-lock.json
    cz-config.js
  
  ### 6. Update the package.json
  Write the item below inside "package.json":

     "scripts": {
       "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
       "commit": "npx git-cz"
     }
     
  Now, you're ready to start using the commit pattern! use ‚Äúnpx git-cz‚Äù to commit

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
